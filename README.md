# Traveling Salesman Algorithm in Java

The project implements an algorithm that solves the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Java programming language. The Traveling Salesman Problem involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is an optimization problem classified as NP-hard, which means that finding an optimal solution within a reasonable time becomes very difficult as the number of cities increases.

## Description

The `TravelingSalesman.java` file contains the implementation of the algorithm solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The code is designed in such a way that one can easily understand the basic concepts behind the problem of the traveling salesman, as well as the method of its solution.

## Features

- Calculating the shortest possible route that passes through all cities exactly once.
- Returning to the starting city after visiting all other cities.
- Demonstrating the use of heuristic algorithms in solving optimization problems.
